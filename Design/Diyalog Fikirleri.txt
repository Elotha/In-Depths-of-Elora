(W for Wise Wizard, P for Pixo)

W: Welcome to the Elora, Pixo.
P: Whooa!
W: This portal is the nearest one to the Life Stone. From now on, you are on your own. We cannot escape our apocalypse for eternity. You have to fetch the Life Stone and save our world.
P: How will I find it?
W: Remember your training. You will find your way.
W: And Pixo...
P: Yeah?
W: You may be our last hope. Be careful.

P: So, the journey has begun. I will fetch the stone, and save the world.
P: And survive, of course.
P: No pressure...
