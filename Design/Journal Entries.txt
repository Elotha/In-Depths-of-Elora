#1 - Everything began at the Decay Zone, in Zeronia. It began with several trees first. Spotted by a group of peasants who were passing by. Trees were turning to pale green dust slowly. They thought it was a disease, thus they chopped those trees, burned them all to ashes. And done! Problem solved. After one month though, when they were passing by again, they realized this was not the truth.
