(2) Syntax, Examples, and Various Notes

-- Text Speed:
These commands should be placed wherever you want the speed to be changed.  Note that you need to revert the speed manually.

Usage Example:
UGH!  This is [S:R]SOOOOOOO[S:N] annoying!#Why can't anybody speak like a [S:S]"normal"[S:N] person?


-- Typing Voices:
These commands should be placed wherever you want the voice to be changed.

Usage Example:
[V:0]After looking at the strange picture, he was moved to tears.
[V:M]"The Funyarinpa!  It's so beautiful!  Wait, what's tha-[V:H] AIIEEEEEE!!"


-- Pauses:
These commands should be placed wherever you want a pause.  Get creative; use pauses where the character would pause in speech.
"You're a big,[P:10] fat[P:10] liar!" has a completely different feel than "You're a big,[P:10] fat liar!", just like in actual speech.
Trying to use this command right before a [E:0] command will result in no pause.

Usage Example:
After I took a long,[P:5] hard look at the painting,[P:15] I came to discover there was nothing wrong with it.
Well,[P:10] the actual artwork was terrible,[P:15] but I expect nothing less from the great, big idiot that is Frank.


--In-text Variables:
This is here mainly due to the limitations of the .txt file system, but using pointers is always good.  You can add pointers or change the existing
ones in the scripts "textbox_var_get" and "textbox_var_set".  The commands themselves can be placed anywhere.  [X:(...)] commands should be placed
wherever in the text you want the variable printed.  The text parser does not know whether a variable is a real or a string when using [XS:(...)].
This can be set in "textbox_var_set".  The [XS:(...)] command can be very helpful.  One example: after answering a question, you can change a
variable and make the player's answer affect the gameplay later.

Usage Example:
You gained [X:0] Experience Points!
You have gained a level!#Your level is now [X:1].
Strength is now [XS:2,38][X:player_strength]!


-- Effects:
Only one effect comes built-in to the engine, and that is the sound effect player.  It should be placed wherever you want the effect.

Usage Example:
Hello, how are y...[F:0,0]!#What is wrong with your face?


-- Colors:
Color commands should be placed wherever you want the text color changed, and you should call the clear command whenever you're finished.
You can nest colors without needing to clear, as well.  The maximum number of colors per box can be changed by altering "textbox_maxcolors" in
the alarm[0] event of obj_textbox.  If you want to change/add colors, just modify the script "textbox_color_get".

Usage Example:
This text is [C:1]Red[C:C].
This one word has [C:1]f[C:2]o[C:3]u[C:4]r[C:C] colors!


-- Name:
This should generally be placed at the very beginning of the box.  However, it will work just fine anywhere.

Usage Example:
[N:Strange man]Welcome, young one.  My name is Hingel Dinglehausen[N:Hingel].
[N:0](PFFT!  HAHAAHA)


-- Questions:
The [Q:(...)] command should be placed as the very last thing in the text.  The [QT:(...)] commands should be placed before the [Q:(...)] command.
The [QP:(...)] commands could be placed anywhere, but should be placed before the [Q:(...)] command for safety.

Usage Example:
Hello.  I love to wear pants.
How about you?[QT:0,All day long][QT:1,Pants are terrible][QP:0,1][QP:1,2][Q:Y]


-- Cut-ins:
All of these can be called whenever you need them.  Remember to [IC:(...)] a cut-in whenever you're finished with it.
You should use [IW:(...)] whenever you have an empty slot in your cut-in data, like in the following example:
(assuming cut-ins 0, 1, and 2 are all active) "[IC:1][IW:2,1]"
If you don't do this, it could cause one or more of your cut-ins to disappear.  This is because after you clear a cut-in, it will reduce the
total number of active cut-ins.  If this number is smaller than the highest-number active cut-in, then any cut-in past that point will disappear.

Usage Example:
[IN:0,0,N,80][IA:0,1,Y,Y][IA:0,2,Y,Y]I don't like this one bit[IS:0,1].
[IO:0,1][IM:0,180][IN:1,5,N,120][IA:0,1,Y,Y][IA:0,2,Y,Y]Still, it's better than that one time[IS:0,1]...
[IC:A]And he proceeded to think about what happened that time.


-- End:
Whenever you're finished with your game's script, you can merge all the text files into one massive script file.  If you don't call this command,
the textbox will just keep going and going.  Call it at the end of every section.

Usage Example:
UGH!  This is SOOOOOOO annoying!#Why can't anybody speak like a "normal" person?[E:0]
Welcome, young one.  My name is Hingel Dinglehausen.
(PFFT!  HAHAAHA)[E:0]
